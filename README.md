## Hi, I'm Tanvi! ðŸŒž

Iâ€™m a junior at UC San Diego, studying the intersection of human-computer interaction and data science. My work focuses on using data to decode behavior and build products that make the world a little bit better, from analyzing large-scale healthcare campaigns to building tools to support educators.
