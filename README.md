## Hi, I'm Tanvi 👋

I’m an undergrad at UC San Diego interested in studying human-computer interaction and its intersection with data to build tools that are educational and accessible. 

Currently I'm...
- 📚 Developing web tools for educators as a Web Development Intern with UCSD ComputingPaths.
- 🍎 Analyzing food distribution and socioeconomic disparities in San Diego as a Data Science Researcher at the Data Science Alliance.
  
Previously I've...
- 💬 Researched how children learn to talk about emotions using computational methods with the Producing and Perceiving Language Lab at UCSB.

I'm looking for opportunities in Data Science and Product Management. You can contact me at tvidyala@ucsd.edu 📫
