### Hi, I'm Tanvi! 🌞

I’m an undergrad at UC San Diego studying human-computer interaction and its intersection with data to build tools that are educational and accessible. 

Currently I'm...
- 🩺 Improving KP.org by optimizing digital campaigns as a Data Analytics Intern at Kaiser Permanente.

Previously I've...
- 🍎 Analyzed food distribution and socioeconomic disparities in San Diego as a Data Science Researcher at the Data Science Alliance.
- 🤖 Researched developers' perceptions of humanness in AI agents and their implications for neurodiverse individuals at the Ujima S&P Group.
- 💬 Researched how children learn to talk about emotions using computational methods with the Producing and Perceiving Language Lab at UCSB.
