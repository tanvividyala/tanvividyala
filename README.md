### Hi, I'm Tanvi! 🌞

Currently I'm...
- 🩺 Improving KP.org by optimizing digital campaigns as a Data Analytics Intern at Kaiser Permanente.

Previously I've...
- 🍎 Analyzed food distribution and socioeconomic disparities in San Diego at the Data Science Alliance

- 💬 Researched how children learn to talk about emotions using computational methods with the Producing and Perceiving Language Lab at UCSB.

I'm looking for opportunities in Data Analytics and Product Management. You can contact me at tvidyala@ucsd.edu 📫
