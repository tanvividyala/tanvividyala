## Hi, I'm Tanvi! ðŸŒž

Iâ€™m a junior at UC San Diego, studying the intersection of human-computer interaction and data science. My work focuses on using data to decode behavior and build products that make the world a little bit better, from analyzing large-scale healthcare campaigns to developing tools to support educators. 

Outside of work, you can find me exploring local cafes, falling down a rabbit hole of video essays on linguistics or urban planning, making music, or journaling on Notion. Check out some of my work [here](https://tanvividyala.framer.media/).
